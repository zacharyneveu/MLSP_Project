For the purposes of this paper, it is assumed that a method for onset detection such as the one presented in \cite{bock_evaluating_nodate} is available and performs well.  The input for the problem is then time-domain frames of music each of which contains one or more onsets located exclusively at the beginning. The goal is to factor a set of frames, $X$, into an approximate linear combination, $Z$, of a dictionary of notes, $\mathbf{D}$, as expressed in equation \eqref{eq:factor}. The dimensionality of the variables are $X \in R^{n\times N}$, $D\in R^{n\times K}$, and $Z \in R^{K \times N}$ where $N$ is the number of audio frames, $n$ is the length of a frame, and $K$ is the number of atoms in the dictionary. The constraint is imposed that the number of non-zero elements in $Z \le k$ where $k \ll K$. For our specific purposes $K$ was chosen to be $88$ because a piano has $88$ possible notes, and $k$ was chosen to be $10$ as the average pianist has $10$ fingers. Solving for $\mathbf{D}$ and $Z$ exactly is an NP-hard problem, so for practical purposes results must be estimated.

	$X \approx \mathbf{D}Z$ & $s.t.\ \|Z\|_0 \le k$
