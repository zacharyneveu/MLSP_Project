Music, in general, has a well defined structure that can be represented in low-dimensional forms such as sheet music or \ac{MIDI} scores. In these compressed forms, the salient features of music (note pitches, velocities, and timing) are stored directly, and can be searched and manipulated easily. Musical performance often deviates in interesting ways from written music, however live performances are most often recorded in audio form and require significant human effort to analyze or manipulate. Transforming music from a high-dimensional audio signal into a sparse symbolic form can be performed algorithmically which can save time and effort.
